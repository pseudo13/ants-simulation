# AntsSimulation

This is a demo project to demonstrate my skill in Angular, frontend application.
The project shows an ants simulation. Each ant can be of specific type with straight, diagonal or drunk movement. Each ant moves randomly based on the type and collects food.
There are 2 versioned components in this public repo. Each version works on its own environment and has the complete code for the simulation.
- Version 1: This is the first prototype of the ants simulation.
- Version 2: This is the second prototype of the ants simulation. The big change is the feature of allowing user to add more ants during runtime.
The implementation is object oriented and contains classes for the setting, maze, ant and the angular components.
<br/>
At first try the simulation was implemented with background worker, however there exist further versions with backend implementation.
The frontend also has more complex user configurations and contains of a simulation visualization in 3D, a comparization of different simulations in a graphical diagram and more.
